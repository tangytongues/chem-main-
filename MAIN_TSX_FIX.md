# üîß Main.tsx Load Error Fix

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Fixed the "Failed to load url /src/main.tsx" error** that was preventing the Vite development server from starting properly.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `server/vite.ts` where:

- The vite configuration was changed to an async function in `vite.config.ts`
- But `server/vite.ts` was trying to spread `...viteConfig` as if it was a plain object
- This caused Vite to receive an invalid configuration and fail to locate the main.tsx entry point

## What Was Fixed

### Before (BROKEN)

```javascript
const vite = await createViteServer({
  ...viteConfig, // ‚ùå viteConfig is now a function, not an object
  configFile: false,
  // ...
});
```

### After (FIXED)

```javascript
// Get the vite config by calling it with command 'serve'
const resolvedViteConfig = await viteConfig({
  command: "serve",
  mode: "development",
});

const vite = await createViteServer({
  ...resolvedViteConfig, // ‚úÖ Now spreading the actual config object
  configFile: false,
  // ...
});
```

## Result

‚úÖ **Development server now starts successfully**  
‚úÖ **Vite can find and load main.tsx correctly**  
‚úÖ **Hot module replacement works properly**  
‚úÖ **Production builds still work correctly**  
‚úÖ **Both conditional base paths work (dev vs production)**

## Technical Details

The fix ensures:

- The async vite config function is properly resolved before being passed to createViteServer
- The correct command and mode are passed to the config function
- Both development and production configurations work correctly
- All path resolutions work as expected

The development server is now fully functional and ready for active development! üéâ
