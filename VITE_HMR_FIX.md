# ðŸ”§ Vite HMR Error Fix

## Problem Solved âœ…

**Fixed the TypeError: Failed to fetch errors** that were occurring in the Vite development server. These errors were preventing Hot Module Replacement (HMR) from working properly.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `vite.config.ts` where:

- `base: "/tinkerlab/"` was being applied in **both** development and production
- In development, this caused HMR to look for assets at wrong paths
- The Vite client couldn't connect properly, causing the fetch errors

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Conditional Base Path

```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
base: "/tinkerlab/",

// After (FIXED)
base: command === "build" ? "/tinkerlab/" : "/",
```

### 2. Proper Async Handling

- Updated `defineConfig` to handle async plugins correctly
- Fixed cartographer plugin loading in development

### 3. Environment-Specific Configuration

- **Development**: Uses `base: "/"` for proper HMR functionality
- **Production**: Uses `base: "/tinkerlab/"` for GitHub Pages deployment

## Result

âœ… **Development server now works without HMR errors**  
âœ… **Hot module replacement functions properly**  
âœ… **Production builds still work correctly for GitHub Pages**  
âœ… **No more "Failed to fetch" errors in console**

## Technical Details

The fix ensures:

- Development mode uses root path `/` so Vite HMR client can connect properly
- Production builds use `/tinkerlab/` path for correct GitHub Pages deployment
- Asset paths are correctly resolved in both environments
- WebSocket connections for HMR work without path conflicts

The development server is now stable and ready for active development! ðŸŽ‰
