# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved ✅

Your GitHub Pages site was showing the README.md instead of your ChemLab Virtual application because GitHub Pages couldn't find an `index.html` file at the root level of your repository.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. File Structure Restructured

**Before:**

```
├── README.md
├── client/
├── server/
├── dist/
│   └── public/
│       ├── index.html  ← Hidden from GitHub Pages
│       └── assets/
└── ...
```

**After:**

```
├── index.html          ← Now visible to GitHub Pages! ✅
├── assets/             ← CSS and JS files ✅
├── README.md
├── client/
├── server/
└── ...
```

### 2. Asset Paths Fixed

- Changed from absolute paths (`/assets/...`) to relative paths (`./assets/...`)
- This ensures assets load correctly on GitHub Pages subdirectory

### 3. Build Process Updated

- Added `base: "./"` to `vite.config.ts` for relative path generation
- Created `npm run deploy:gh-pages` script for easy deployment
- Updated `.gitignore` to allow root-level deployment files

## Your Deployment Process

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
npm run deploy:gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Build for GitHub Pages
npm run build:gh-pages

# 2. Copy files to root
cp dist/public/index.html .
cp -r dist/public/assets .

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

## Result

Your ChemLab Virtual application is now properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment at:
**https://tangytongues.github.io/tinkerlab/**

## Files Changed

- ✅ `index.html` - Moved to root with relative paths
- ✅ `assets/` - Moved to root level
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Added `base: "./"` for relative paths
- ✅ `package.json` - Added deployment scripts
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Updated to allow deployment files
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated with deployment instructions

The site should now display your ChemLab Virtual Chemistry Simulator instead of the README file!
