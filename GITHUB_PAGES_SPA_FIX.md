# ðŸ”§ GitHub Pages SPA Routing Fix

## Problem Solved âœ…

The "404 Page Not Found â€“ Did you forget to add the page to the router?" error has been fixed! This error occurs when GitHub Pages can't handle client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added 404.html Redirect

- âœ… Created `404.html` file that redirects all unknown routes to `index.html`
- âœ… Preserves the original URL path for client-side router to handle

### 2. Updated Vite Configuration

- âœ… Changed `base: "./"` to `base: "/tinkerlab/"` in `vite.config.ts`
- âœ… Now asset paths correctly point to `/tinkerlab/assets/...`

### 3. Added SPA Redirect Handler

- âœ… Added JavaScript to `index.html` to handle redirects from 404.html
- âœ… Preserves navigation state and URL integrity

## Files Modified

- âœ… `404.html` (NEW) - Handles all unknown routes
- âœ… `vite.config.ts` - Updated base path for GitHub Pages
- âœ… `client/index.html` - Added redirect handler script
- âœ… `index.html` (root) - Rebuilt with correct configuration

## Deploy to Fix the 404 Error

**Run these commands to deploy the fix:**

```bash
# All files are ready - just commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages SPA routing - Add 404.html redirect"
git push origin main
```

## How It Works

1. **User visits `/experiment/1`** â†’ GitHub Pages can't find this file
2. **GitHub Pages serves `404.html`** â†’ Redirects to `/index.html?redirect=/experiment/1`
3. **`index.html` loads** â†’ JavaScript extracts the redirect parameter
4. **React Router takes over** â†’ Navigates to the correct route `/experiment/1`

## Result

Your ChemLab Virtual site at **https://tangytongues.github.io/tinkerlab/** will now:

âœ… Show the homepage correctly  
âœ… Handle direct links to `/experiment/1` and `/experiment/2`  
âœ… Support browser back/forward navigation  
âœ… Work with all client-side routes

**No more 404 errors!** ðŸŽ‰

## Test Links That Should Work After Deploy

- https://tangytongues.github.io/tinkerlab/ (Homepage)
- https://tangytongues.github.io/tinkerlab/experiment/1 (Aspirin Synthesis)
- https://tangytongues.github.io/tinkerlab/experiment/2 (Acid-Base Titration)

Commit and push the changes above, then test these URLs in about 1-2 minutes after GitHub Pages updates!
